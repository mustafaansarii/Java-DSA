    "### Tutorial: What is Backtracking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves incrementally building a solution by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end. It is particularly useful for problems where you need to explore multiple possibilities to find a solution. Common applications include searching for a path in a maze, solving puzzles like Sudoku, or finding the best configuration for a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that involves searching every possible combination to solve a computational problem. The process involves exploring potential solutions, checking if they are feasible, and then either continuing to build on them or undoing the steps if they lead to an invalid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Terminologies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Candidate**: A potential choice or element that can be added to the current solution. For example, in the N-Queens problem, a candidate is a position where a queen can be placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Solution**: A valid and complete configuration that satisfies all problem constraints. For instance, in Sudoku, a solution is a filled grid that adheres to all Sudoku rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partial Solution**: An intermediate or incomplete configuration being constructed during the backtracking process. This could be a partially filled grid in Sudoku or partially placed queens in the N-Queens problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decision Space**: The set of all possible candidates or choices at each decision point. It includes all the options available for the current step in the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Point**: A specific step in the algorithm where a candidate is chosen and added to the partial solution. For example, choosing which cell to place a queen in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feasible Solution**: A partial or complete solution that adheres to all constraints. A solution where no two queens attack each other in the N-Queens problem is considered feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Dead End**: Occurs when a partial solution cannot be extended without violating constraints. For example, placing a queen in a position where it conflicts with another queen would be a dead end.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Backtrack**: Involves undoing previous decisions and returning to a prior decision point to try alternative choices. This process continues until a valid solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Search Space**: Includes all possible combinations of candidates and choices. The algorithm explores this space to find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Optimal Solution**: In optimization problems, the best possible solution according to a specific criterion. For instance, in the Knapsack problem, the optimal solution would maximize the total value of items within a weight limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Backtracking Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Problems**: These involve searching for a feasible solution. For example, finding a configuration of N queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimization Problems**: These require finding the best solution among all feasible solutions. An example is the Traveling Salesman Problem, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enumeration Problems**: These involve finding all possible feasible solutions. For example, generating all permutations of a set or finding all possible Sudoku solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: N-Queens Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-Queens problem is a classic example where backtracking is used. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Algorithm Outline**:\n",
    "1. **Place a Queen**: Place a queen in a valid position in the first row.\n",
    "2. **Move to the Next Row**: Move to the next row and place a queen in a valid position.\n",
    "3. **Check Constraints**: Ensure no two queens threaten each other.\n",
    "4. **Backtrack**: If a position leads to a dead end, backtrack to the previous row and try a different position.\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Continue this process until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
